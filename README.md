# Warm up / Drill Chooser

Goal: Make a warm up app that can choose my warm up at random.

Description: Idea is that I can be able to choose a set of exercises, drils and concepts to train. I want to be able to cover all of the pathways I like. I should be able to add, remove and edit drills I have made. I should have gifs or visuals to help me show my warmup exercises.

Advanced would be adding a history of what drills I have done. Maybe setting a focus on what drills I want to do. Adding a favourites tab. Adding a reverse streak on what drills I haven't done.
